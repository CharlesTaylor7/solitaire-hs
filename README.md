# A Solitaire solver
Initially, this is a solver for Boring Solitaire.
After that works, I want to solve Yukon Solitaire, Free Cell & Spider.

# Boring Solitaire Rules
A vastly simplified Spider solitaire:
  - Cards are suitless and have rank between 1 to 5
  - There are 3 piles of 5 cards each with the top 2 rows face up.
  - There is no leftover deck to deal from.

# To Do
- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm
- Make search deterministic
